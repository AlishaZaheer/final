        <h2> Hi!</h2> 
        <h1> My name is Alisha. I'm a graphic designer and artist from Fremont, California. My parents are Pakistani, which makes
            me a Pakistani American.
            I have been doing art and design for many years. It's not just my hobby, it's my passion.
        Most of the inspiration for my artwork comes from things like my culture, my family, and myself. I love 
        creating self portraits because I find it interesting to look at myself in different ways. My main 
    art medium is digital art, but I do explore other mediums from time to time. Some of my other hobbies 
include, reading (I have a very extensive book collection), watching movies (my favorites include, You've Got Mail and Beauty and the Beast), and playing soccer. 
I'm also a huge fan of comicbook and superhero related movies and shows. I love Marvel/DC, Star Wars and Disney (I'm a huge nerd).
I don't have any pets, but my favorite animals are cute kitties. My zodiac sign is Gemini, which is what inspired 
the <a href="../images/Gemini.png">artwork</a> in the background of this website. I hope you enjoy looking through my portfolio and follow my
artwork on Instagram and TikTok! </main> </h1>
